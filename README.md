Golden Drainer stands at the forefront of advanced draining technology currently available. It is compatible with major networks including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Fantom, Optimism, zkSync, Base, Era, and Pulse. Asset discovery in user wallets is powered by a trusted DeBank provider, with options to switch to Ankr, Zapper, or OpenSea in the settings. The Drainer efficiently identifies the primary coin in a wallet, ERC-20 tokens, and NFTs, all of which can be withdrawn automatically.

The script supports an extensive range of wallets, exceeding 300 in total. Two connection methods are available: native and via WalletConnect. Native wallets interact directly with the drainer and include MetaMask, Coinbase, Binance Wallet, and Trust Wallet. Other wallets can connect through WalletConnect by scanning a QR code displayed on the screen from a mobile device or accessing the site from a mobile phone and selecting an installed wallet option. Most mobile wallets are compatible with WalletConnect, functioning with both versions.
